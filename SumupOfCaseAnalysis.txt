Best Case

Definition:
The minimum time an algorithm takes for the most favorable input.

Big-O notation:
Often written as Ω (Omega)

Example (Linear Search):

- Target is at index 0

- Only 1 comparison

Time Complexity:

Ω(1)

Why it matters:

- Shows theoretical minimum

- Rarely reflects real-world performance


Average Case

Definition:
The expected time over all possible inputs (assuming a probability distribution).

Big-O notation:
Often written as Θ (Theta)

Example (Linear Search):

Target is somewhere in the middle

~n / 2 comparisons

Time Complexity:

Θ(n)

Why it matters:

Best representation of typical performance

Often hardest to calculate

Worst Case (Most used)

Definition:
The maximum time an algorithm can take for the most unfavorable input.

Big-O notation:
Written as O (Big-O)

Example (Linear Search):

Target is last element or not present

n comparisons

Time Complexity:

O(n)

Why it matters:

- Guarantees upper bound

- Used heavily in interviews & exams

- Helps design safe and scalable systems

Best case = lucky input
Average case = realistic input
Worst case = unlucky input (but guaranteed bound)
